<h2> Troubleshooting Steps </h2>

Store Manager: XXX

Contact Person: we would call Staff.



 <h2> Summary of Visit: </h2>



I checked in with Remote Support, and the agent informed me to check for a new fan, if there is one I should replace the fan or get back to Support if thereâ€™s none. I introduced myself to Store Manager , who directed me to the back office where I met with A staff who took me to the rack where I gathered every necessary information.



  <h2> Investigation: </h2>



A Staff provided information about the noise issue, stating that it started 2 days ago in the afternoon. The noise lasted for a few minutes, stopped, and then resumed after 10 minutes, continuing until closing hours. However, the noise was not present at the time of my visit. The Manager reiterated the same.



 <h2> Search for Replacement Fan: </h2>



A staff and I searched for the new fan that CPT had allegedly sent, but we were unable to locate it.



 <h2> Follow-up with CPT: </h2>



I contacted Tech Support, and confirmed that a new fan had not been shipped yet. However, they will send a new fan as soon as possible.



  <h2> Next Steps: </h2>

A follow-up will be required to ensure the new fan is received and installed correctly to resolve the noise issue.



 <h2> Outcome: </h2>


The issue remains unresolved pending the arrival and installation of the new fan. Further action will be required to complete the repair.
